classes needed:

LightsPower - control the interface with the GPIO.

EventParser - reads in a file with light control instructions and creates an array of events

Event - data structure to specify an event - to turn on or off leds, and an array of leds to perform the event on. 

lightShow - the brains - calls eventParser to get the events, starts the music, and starts the light show.
